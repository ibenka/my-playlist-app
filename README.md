A collaborative web application for posting songs to a playlist. Anyone with internet connection can contribute, listen, favorite, comment, and enjoy!

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

Developed by Justin Pinili

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
